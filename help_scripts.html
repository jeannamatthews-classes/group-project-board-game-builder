    <h1 style="font-size: 3rem;">Scripting Rules</h1>

    <p class = 'center'><span >
      The main thing that sets this program apart from other board game simulators is that it enforces the rules of the games you make...
      but that means you have to make those rules first! <em>Scripting rules</em> are how you create the rules of games... so how do they work, exactly?
    </span></p>

    <div class="image-wrapper">
      <img src="images/help/script example.png" alt="Scripting Form Screenshot">
    </div>
    <div class="caption">A simple example script.</div>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>Scripting rules aren't quite a programming language, but they do have some things in common with one - they're more like Scratch-style block coding than a "real" programming language.</p>
    <p>
      A scripting rule has a <strong>type</strong>, which determines what that rule does. Many types of scripting rules also have <strong>arguments</strong>, which are often themselves scripting rules,
      which means that a complete scripting rule likely consists of a lot of nested scripting rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Individual pieces or types do not contain scripting rules. <em>Types</em> of pieces and tiles are what have scripting rules, and then those
      types can be assigned to individual pieces and tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outermost scripting rule, the one that's directly contained in a type, in a button, or in the global scripts list, also has a <strong>trigger</strong>
      that determines when the rule will be run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some scripting rule types perform actions, while others return values. The types of things that value-returning ones can return
      include <strong>numbers</strong>, <strong>booleans</strong> (a true or false value), <strong>strings</strong> of letters,
      <strong>objects</strong> like pieces and tiles, <strong>object types</strong> like piece types and tile types,
      and <strong>arrays</strong> of any of the above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scripting rule types that perform actions technically return the boolean value <em>true</em> after performing their action,
      and indeed an outermost scripting rule <em>should</em> return a boolean. These booleans are used to assess whether an action
      in the game was valid or not: if, when a player performs an action, any of the scripting rules triggered by that action
      return <em>false</em>, that action was not valid, and that action does not occur.
    </p>

    <h1>Scripting Rule Types</h1>

    <h2>Fundamental Types</h2>
    <p>The most important types of scripting rules are probably <strong>Value</strong>, <strong>if-then-else</strong>, and <strong>Run Multiple Scripts</strong>.</p>
    <p>
      A <strong>Value</strong> script returns a set value. This value can be either a number, a boolean, or a string. If the value is a number
      or a string, a textbox is provided to change what that value is. If the value is a boolean, you can click the green box around that value
      to switch it between true or false. Since the arguments to most scripting rules will themselves be scripting rules, Value scripting rules
      are often the ones at the bottom layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <strong>if-then-else</strong> script has three arguments. The first argument is the <em>if</em> argument, which should return a boolean.
      When an if-then-else script is run, if the boolean check performed by the <em>if</em> argument returns <em>true</em>, then
      the <em>then</em> script is run. If the <em>if</em> check returns false, then the <em>else</em> script is run.
      The <em>then</em> and <em>else</em> arguments do not have restrictions on what they should do - sometimes you'll want to use them to perform
      a different action based on the <em>if</em> check, sometimes you'll want to use them to return different values based on the <em>if</em>
      check. If you want to check more than one condition and have more than two options on which script to run,
      you'll want to nest additional if-then-else scripts inside the <em>then</em> and/or <em>else</em> arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most scripting rule types have a fixed number of arguments, leaving you with limited room to perform a series of actions
      all in a row. This is what the <strong>Run Multiple Scripts</strong> type is for: you can add as many scripting rules to
      the arguments of a Run Multiple Scripts script as you wish, and the Run Multiple Scripts script will run each of its
      argument scripts in order, returning whatever value that the last of its argument scripts returns.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporter Types</h2>
    <p>These types of scripting rules return data of objects or of the game in general; I'm covering this group first because it provides context for the following groups.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>X Coordinate</strong> and <strong>Y Coordinate</strong> types report the coordinates of an object on the board.
        In this program, positive X is right, positive Y is down. These script types, and a few others, have the object they're
        looking at default to being the "caller", which is the piece or tile that called this script from its piece type or tile
        type, but this can be changed to have them report the coordinates (or other data) of a different object.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Object Types</strong> returns an array of all of the types that the given object has.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Piece Owner</strong> returns the player number that that piece is considered "owned" by.
        This ownership ID number doesn't have any inherent effects, it only does something if you
        include scripts that check it.
      </li>
      <li>
        The turn number begins at Turn #1 and increases by 1 whenever a full rotation of player turns wraps back around
        to player 1, and the <strong>Turn Number</strong> script type just returns whatever the turn number is.
        Likewise, the <strong>Player Turn</strong> script returns the player number whose turn it is, and the
        <strong>Turn Phase</strong> script returns the current "turn phase", a number which has no inherent effects
        but could be quite useful to incorporate into the rules for your game.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Board Width</strong> and <strong>Board Height</strong> return the dimensions of the board.
        These types are useful when looping over tiles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tile at Coordinates</strong> takes two numbers as arguments and returns the tile at those coordinates.
        <strong>Tile Here</strong> returns whatever tile the piece is currently on if a piece called it, while if a tile
        called it then it just returns the tile itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pieces on Tile</strong> returns an array of all of the pieces on a given tile. If the script was called
        by a piece, that piece is forced to the front of the array.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>All Pieces</strong> returns an array of all of the pieces on the board as a whole.
        If the script was called by a piece, that piece is forced to the front of the array.
        <strong>All Tiles</strong> returns an array of all tiles on the board, sorted in reading order (left to right,
        top to bottom).
      </li>
      <li>
        Each piece and tile has a unique object ID number, and a <strong>Object ID</strong> script
        returns the ID of a given object. I'm not sure what use this has, but perhaps you'll find a way to use it in
        a game?
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Caller</strong> script returns whatever object called this scripting rule.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>New Piece Sprite</strong> and <strong>New Tile Sprite</strong> create new sprites. Currently, the only
        scripting rule types that use sprites are Add Piece, Change Piece Sprite, and Change Tile Sprite.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose Piece Type</strong> and <strong>Choose Tile Type</strong> return a specific piece type or tile
        type.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is an array of objects that are considered "selected"; at the start of each turn, this array is reset to be empty.
        <strong>Selected Objects</strong> returns this array of selected objects.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Action Types</h2>
    <p>These types of scripting rules perform actions that change the state of the game, such as moving pieces or progressing the turn order.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove Piece</strong>: Removes this piece from the board.
        As of the current version of this project, pieces only exist on the board, so this removes this piece from the game entirely.
        Does nothing if the owner of this scripting rule is not a piece type, since tiles can't be removed from the board.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are two script types that change a piece's position. <strong>Move Piece</strong>'s
        arguments are the amount that that piece's X and Y coordinates will <em>change</em> by
        (keep in mind that positive X is right, positive Y is down),
        <strong>Move Piece to Coordinates</strong>'s arguments are what that piece's X and Y coordinates will
        be <em>set</em> to.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change Piece Owner</strong> changes what player number that piece is considered "owned" by.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Type</strong> adds a particular piece type to a piece or a tile type to a tile, if that object does not
        already have that type. Normally that type is added to the end of its array of types, but you can set the <em>index</em>
        argument to a nonnegative whole number to have it inserted at that index of the array instead (more about arrays later).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove Type</strong> removes a type from a piece or tile if it has that type.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Piece</strong> adds a new piece to the board. The arguments of this script type are the array of types
        that new piece will have, the coordinates on the board that that piece will be placed at, the owner player number
        of that piece, and the sprite the piece will have.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change Turn Phase</strong> updates the turn phase to a new number, or to the end of the turn.
        <strong>Using a Change Turn Phase script with the "End Turn" setting is the only way to progress to the next player's turn.</strong>
        (Note: If you use a Turn Phase script after a turn has ended but before the next one starts, the turn phase will be considered to be Infinity)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>End Game</strong> ends the game; its argument is the player number of the winner of the game. If this
        <em>winner</em> argument is not a positive whole number, the game is considered a draw.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Change Piece Sprite</strong> and <strong>Change Tile Sprite</strong> change the sprite of that object
        to the new sprite specified in the arguments to the scripting rule.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Select Object</strong> adds an object to the end of the selected objects array if it's not already in the selected objects array,
        <strong>Deselect Object</strong> removes an object from the selected objects array if it is in the selected objects array, and
        <strong>Clear Selected Objects</strong> resets the selected objects array to be empty.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Unlike Reporter scripts, Action scripts don't by default let you change what object they refer to,
      they always perform their actions on the piece or tile that called them. If you wish to change this,
      such as having a script called by one piece cause a different piece to be removed, the
      <strong>Have Another Object run a Script</strong> type lets you specify an object and then run a script as if
      that other object is the one running it.
    </p>

    <h2>Operator Types</h2>
    <p>These scripting rules perform operations on values, such as checking for equality or doing basic math.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>==</strong> returns true if its two arguments are equal, false otherwise.
        <strong>!=</strong> is the opposite, returning true if its two arguments are not equal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>&lt;</strong>, <strong>&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;=</strong>, and <strong>&gt;=</strong>
        are inequalities that compare two numbers and return true or false.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NOT</strong> takes a boolean and returns its opposite: it returns <em>true</em> if its argument is
        <em>false</em>, it returns <em>false</em> if its argument is <em>true</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, and <strong>XOR</strong> take two boolean arguments and return
        a boolean. AND returns <em>true</em> if both of its arguments are <em>true</em>, OR returns <em>true</em>
        if at least one of its arguments is <em>true</em>, and XOR returns <em>true</em> if exactly one (i.e. one but not both)
        of its arguments is <em>true</em>. (In case this comes up, I'll note here that if the first argument to AND returns false
        or the first argument to OR returns true, the second argument won't be evaluated at all, since it wouldn't change what the AND or OR would return)
      </li>
      <li>
        There are several math operators that take two arguments. <strong>+</strong> adds the two arguments,
        <strong>-</strong> subtracts the two arguments, <strong>*</strong> multiplies the two arguments,
        <strong>/</strong> divides the two arguments, and <strong>**</strong> is exponentiation.
        <strong>%</strong> is the "modulo" operator, which returns the remainder of division: for example,
        8 % 3 = 2, because when you divide 8 by 3, the remainder is 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>abs</strong> returns the absolute value of a number. <strong>sign</strong> returns the sign of a number:
        1 if the number is positive, -1 if the number is negative, 0 if the number is zero.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Random Integer</strong> and <strong>Random Decimal</strong> generate a random number between the two given
        bounds (inclusive, so if the bounds are 0 and 10, Random Integer could generate any integer between 0 and 10, including
        0 or 10). The number will always be an integer for Random Integer. For Random Decimal, it's a random real number,
        which most likely <em>won't</em> be an integer (though, for those who know what this means, remember how floating point
        precision works!).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Concatenate Strings</strong> takes two strings and combines them into a single string, so
        "Hi" and "Yes" are put together into "HiYes".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Character of String</strong> returns a particular letter in a string. The index starts at 0, so
        index 0 is the first letter of the string, index 1 is the second letter of the string, index 2 is the third
        letter of the string, and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Slice of String</strong> is similar to Character of String, but instead of just returning a single
        letter, it returns a string containing the letters between two indices. For example, if the left index is 1
        and the right index is 4, then it returns a string containing the letters from the 2nd character in the string
        up through the 5th character in the string. (Unlike some programming languages, both the left index and the right
        index themselves are included)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repeat While</strong> is in this category because I didn't know where else to put it. A Repeat While
        script takes two scripting rules as argument, a <em>while</em> script (which returns a boolean) and a
        <em>repeat</em> script (which may do anything). When the Repeat While script is run, it checks the <em>while</em>
        script, and if that returns true, it runs the <em>repeat</em> script. It continues doing this, repeating the
        scripts over and over again until the <em>while</em> script returns false, at which point it stops the loop.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>For those familiar with programming, you may skip the following explanation paragraph on what arrays are, they work how they do in most programming languages.</p>
    <p>
      An <strong>array</strong> is a list of things. In the context of this program, those things may be numbers, booleans, strings,
      objects, types, or other arrays that themselves contain things. We call the things inside arrays <em>elements</em> of that array.
      Arrays are ordered: each element of the array has an index number. This index number starts at 0, so the first element of the array has index number 0,
      the second element of the array has index number 1, the third element of the array has index number 2, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scripting rule types include some types for working with arrays, including creating new ones, adding elements to them and
      removing elements from them, and finding elements within them. This program generally tries to make sure scripts that return
      particular types can't be placed in scripts that aren't looking for an argument of that type, but currently there is not
      any type safety included for arguments of arrays, so make sure you know what you're doing when you use arrays.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Create an Array</strong> creates a new array. Its arguments are the things that that array will contain.
        Creating new arrays is probably only useful if you're going to save that array as a variable (more on those below)
        to use again later.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Array Length</strong> takes an array as its argument and returns a number, that being the amount of 
        elements that array contains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add to Array</strong> adds a new element at the end of an array, and <strong>Remove Last Element of Array</strong>
        removes the element at the end of an array from that array.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Array Element at Index</strong> takes an array and a number and returns the element of that array with that index
        number: for example, if the number is 2, the scripting rule returns the third element of that array.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Array Index of Element</strong> searches an array for a particular element. If that array does contain
        that element, it returns the index number of that element in that array (if that element appears in that array
        multiple times, it returns its lowest index number). If that array does not contain that element, it returns -1.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Slice of Array</strong> returns an array containing the elements of the given array between two
        index numbers. For example, if the left index is 1 and the right index is 4, then it returns an array containing the
        elements from the 2nd element in the array up through the 5th element in the array.
        (Unlike some programming languages, both the left index and the right index themselves are included)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Other Properties of Scripting Rules</h1>

    <h2>Triggers</h2>
    <p>An outermost scripting rule has a <em>trigger</em>, which determines when that rule will be run, and what the caller is considered to be when it does run.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>When this piece moves</strong>: This script runs when the piece that owns the script moves, i.e. when
        a Move Piece or Move Piece to Coordinates script is run by that piece. The X Coordinate and Y Coordinate
        of the piece during a script with this trigger will be considered to be that piece's coordinates after moving,
        not its coordinates before moving.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>When this piece lands on a tile</strong>: Similar to When this piece moves, but it explicitly triggers
        <em>after</em> When this piece moves scripts, since the act of the piece landing comes after the act of it moving.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>When this tile is landed on</strong>: Triggers when a piece lands on the tile that owns this script.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>When this piece is removed</strong>: This script runs when the piece that owns the script is removed, i.e. when
        a Remove Piece script is run by that piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Start Game</strong>: This script runs when the game starts. For this trigger type
        and the next few trigger types, global scripts run first, then piece scripts (in order of object ID, I think),
        then tile scripts (in board position reading order, i.e. left to right, top to bottom).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>End Turn</strong> and <strong>Start Turn</strong> scripts run during the transition between turns.
        End Turn scripts run before the player turn switches, Start Turn scripts run after the player turn switches.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>End Game</strong> scripts run when the game ends, after the rest of the scripts on the game-ending
        turn have finished.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Object Clicked</strong> scripts run when the piece or tile that owns that scripting rule is clicked.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>Argument</strong> scripting rule type lets you access data relating to the event that triggered the rule.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the trigger is "When this piece moves", the Argument options are the amount that the X coordinate of that piece
        changed by and the amount that the Y coordinate of that piece changed by.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the trigger is "When this piece lands on a tile", the Argument option is the tile that the piece landed on.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the trigger is "When this tile is landed on", the Argument option is the piece that landed on the tile.
      </li>
      <li>
        In all other cases, the relevant data can already be accessed by the scripting rule, so the Argument type
        has no options.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>variable</strong> is a piece of data (a number, boolean, string, object, type, array, etc.) that is saved
      somewhere so it can be reused later (you'll typically want to be using Run Multiple Scripts scripts when working with these).
      In this program, a variable has a name and a value; the name is always a string of letters, the value can be any of the types
      of things mentioned previously. A variable's name is permanent, but its value can be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three places variables can be found:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Within a scripting rule. A variable exists across an entire scripting rule, i.e. starting from the outermost rule
        and going all the way down (it's the same variable across all the nested rules, not separate copies of it). Variables
        of scripting rules only exist while that rule is running and are discarded once the rule finishes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Within an object (a piece or tile). The game creator lets you set global variables that a piece or tile starts with on
        a per-type basis, but once the game starts each piece or tile has its own copy of that variable which can have its
        value changed independently.
      </li>
      <li>
        As a global variable that can be accessed by any scripting rule anywhere in the game. The game creator
        lets you set global variables that exist at the start of the game as numbers, booleans, or strings, but
        scripts can let you change them into other types as well.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <strong>Return Variable of Rule</strong>, <strong>Return Variable of Object</strong>,
      and <strong>Return Global Variable</strong> scripting rule types take a string as their argument and return
      the value of the variable in that location with that string as its name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Edit Variable of Rule</strong>, <strong>Edit Variable of Object</strong>,
      and <strong>Edit Global Variable</strong> scripting rule types take a string and a value as arguments, and
      they take the variable in that location with the argument string as its name and change its value to the argument
      value. If that rule/object/the global variables doesn't/don't already have a variable with that name, a variable with
      that name is created with that value.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is probably a good place to note that, if a scripting rule ever tries to access some value that's not defined
      (a Return Variable script on a variable name that hasn't been edited into existence yet, Array Element at Index on
      an index after the array's end, reporters like coordinates when run in a global script rather than on an object,
      Argument script called when the trigger type has no arguments, etc.), the move is declared invalid,
      as if the top-level script had returned false.
    </p>

    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike pieces and tiles, buttons don't have types, they exist as independent entities. A button has two
      arrays of rules: its click scripts and its visibility rules. A button is only visible (and thus able to be clicked)
      if, at the current moment in the game, all of its visibility rules do not return false when run. When a button is
      clicked, all of its click scripts are run.
