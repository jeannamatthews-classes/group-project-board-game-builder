We didn't have any written notes we made before the presentation, but we did have a meeting where we discussed our plans verbally.


During our final meeting we also determined:
Sophia would present the game creation and Aaron would present gameplay using the example games he had made.
We would leave the old chess UI in to show versatility of the editor.
We should show off the game editor mostly after loading in a pre-made game to save time.
We could launch a netlify deploy, and send the files via email, so that we would not have connect our own devices.

Points we wanted to cover:
Index / Help pages. (brief)
Sophia covers editors
    - Show the element editor windows.
    - Show how to use the toolbars.
    - Show "hidden" features (right clicks)
    - Show the Scripting Rules and briefly explain, triggers, "type" structures, and nesting of rules.
    - Explain how rules are attached to types (or buttons / global scripts ) and how types are attached to pieces.
    - Show how the layout editor can be used to toggle and arrange elements, as well as show global variables.
    - Planned to show more about how individual sprites could be edited, but we never got around to this. 
Aaron covers Gameplay UI 
    - Use the old chess game to demonstrate how text, colors, and basic shapes can be used to generalize our BGB to other games.
    - Use NEW chess game to demonstrate pieces with different rules for movement, piece capture, and how we handle checkmates right now.
    - Use the checkers game to demonstrate button visibility rules + manual turn end. 
    - Use TicTacToe/Connect4 to show how pieces (with sprites) can be added to the game dynamically through scripting.
    - Use Connect4 to show simulated gravity mechanics, and to be the "base game" one can modify.
    - Use the Connect4 with 4 gravity modes to show that new games and game variants can be accomplished through the editor.
    - Show at some point how games can be restarted.

    - We were also planning to use Chess/Checkers to show how Sprites can be changed dynamically (pawn to queen, checker piece to king piece), but we didn't get to this.

We thought about showing JSON file looked like, too, but the class computer didn't have any convenient way of opening them, so we didn't end up doing this.

We also created a list of our future plans for this project.
We didn't explicitly plan for this to be part of the presentation, but we hoped it might help us answer certain questions people might have.

Here is the list:

    Before Semester Ends:
    Editing board size during game creation
    Make a couple more example games

    After Semester Ends
    Add more sprites (enter SVGs? Let users combine multiple existing sprites?)
    Collapsible scripting rules, copy layers of scripting rules (add layers to scripting rule layers?)
    Hex and triangle boards
    Various UI updates (change border colors of tiles?)
    “Title screens” that show up after loading a game but before starting it (so there can be a written explanation of that game’s rules) and/or just having a written rules paragraph that can be shown on the screen during gameplay
    Allow saving and loading in-progress games
    Fix it so board resizes properly with window in gameplay

    Post-Release
    Player inventories
    Secrecy (display variables for pieces and tiles)
    Popup events
    LAN Hosting
    Local server hosting????? (far future plan?) 
    - the latter would increase the effort gap between using our software and just making your own from scratch. However, it's a far future plan for now.
