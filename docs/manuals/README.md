### Deployment

This project will be hosted as a website online.
Right now, we have a deployment of the project at https://board-game-builder.netlify.app/. We intend to move this to a more permanent hosting place, probably GitHub Pages, once the project is ready to be fully released.

### Usage

This project has two types of users that may wish to use it: game creators and game players.
Game creators will use the game creation tools to create a board, pieces on that board, buttons, etc., and assign scripting rules to types of pieces and tiles that control the rules of the game. Once a game is finished, it can be saved as a JSON file.
Game players will input a JSON file of a game into the project to play that board game.
We have created a user manual for our project, located at https://github.com/jeannamatthews-classes/group-project-board-game-builder/blob/main/help.html in the github, which corresponds to https://board-game-builder.netlify.app/help.html in the deployment.
