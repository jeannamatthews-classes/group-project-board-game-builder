This project will be hosted as a website online.
As of May 15, 2025, the project has been released on Aaron's personal website: https://mathcookie17.github.io/BlueTile-BGB/.

If you'd rather have the files downloaded so you can use the project locally, then if you download the whole project from this GitHub repository, you can then run index.html in a web browser of your choice, and you'll be running the project.
