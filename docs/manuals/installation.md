This project will be hosted as a website online.
Right now, we have a deployment of the project at https://board-game-builder.netlify.app/. We intend to move this to a more permanent hosting place, probably GitHub Pages, once the project is ready to be fully released.

If you'd rather have the files downloaded so you can use the project locally, then if you download the whole project from this GitHub repository, you can then run index.html in a web browser of your choice, and you'll be running the project.
