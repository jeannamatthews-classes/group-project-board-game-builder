Aaron, at least, intends to keep working on this project so it can reach a full release state, and Sophia has considered continuing to work on it as well. Here's a list of things we'd like to do for this in the future:

### Before Full Release
* Editing board size during game creating
* Make a couple more example games
* Add more sprites (enter SVGs? Let users combine multiple existing sprites?)
* Collapsible scripting rules (add layers to scripting rule layers?)
* Hex and triangle boards
* Various UI updates (change border colors of tiles?)
* “Title screens” that show up after loading a game but before starting it (so there can be a written explanation of that game’s rules) and/or just having a written rules paragraph that can be shown on the screen during gameplay
* Allow saving and loading in-progress games
* Fix it so board resizes properly with window
* Hide Argument scripting rule type if there are no trigger arguments, hide Caller scripting rule type for global scripts, etc.

### Post-Release
* Player inventories
* Secrecy (display variables for pieces and tiles)
* Popup events
* LAN Hosting
* Local server hosting????? (far future plan?)
