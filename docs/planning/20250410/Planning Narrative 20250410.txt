The UI editors have been finished at this point, and Sophia has just about finished merging those together.
Aaron has tested the object clicking/selection scripting rules, we've made a presentation for RAPS, and Jackson has been working
on the save codes.
Next week, we will begin making the gameplay side of the UI (probably mainly led by Sophia),
and Jackson will finish the save codes. Aaron will be taking a backseat to the gameplay UI
and will instead start making the scripting for some example games.
