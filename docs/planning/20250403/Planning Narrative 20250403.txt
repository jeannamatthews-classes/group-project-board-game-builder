So far, much of the backend code for the way pieces move, rules are triggered, and so on has been made.
We're now mainly focused on the UI: Aaron has made UI for editing scripting rules,
Sophia has made good progress on the UI for the central editor for things like the board and pieces,
Jackson is working on UI for editing buttons, and Landon is working on UI for making types of pieces and tiles.
Next, we'll finish those items, Aaron will add the ability for scripting rules to control what happens
when a piece or tile is selected during gameplay, Sophia will take the UI pages we've made so far and connect them together,
Jackson will start making the code to save game rules in a file, and Landon will make our presentation slides for RAPS.
