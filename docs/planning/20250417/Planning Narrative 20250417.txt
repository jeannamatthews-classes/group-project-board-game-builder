We're falling way behind on the gameplay UI. Jackson has been working on save codes, Aaron has made a couple backend touch-ups and has made some example games to test
the scripting rules code more (and to demo), Sophia hasn't been in good communication with us, and we haven't found much for Landon to do because we don't know how to start
the gameplay UI without Sophia's input.
