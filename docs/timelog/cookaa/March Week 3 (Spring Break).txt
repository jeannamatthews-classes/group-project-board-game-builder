On Friday, March 14, I spent around 1 hour making some examples of what scripting rules would look like
for some key interactions in our milestone games, such as moving a rook in chess.

On Monday, March 17, I spent around 1 hour and 50 minutes writing my second version of the ScriptingRule class.

March 19: 57 minutes (3:09 PM to 4:06 PM) were spent doing the start of testing the code I've made so far.
Most of it was spent setting up the testing, not quite doing the testing yet.

March 21: About two hours were spent. Today, I made BGBStructuredClone, made TileType and PieceType actually do things,
added the first four "triggers" for scripts, and tested the scripts and triggers by making the movement rules
for the non-pawn chess pieces (no capturing or collisions yet, just the rules on what directions they're allowed to move).

March 23: Spent around one hour attempting to implement capturing into my testing script
(making progress, but not finished yet)
