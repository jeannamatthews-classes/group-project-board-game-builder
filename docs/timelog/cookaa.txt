Before March 11: So far, I have created our class diagram and our object diagram, and I created the first drafts of the class files,
including an outdated draft of the ScriptingRule.js file that I will later be redoing in a different format.

On Friday, March 14, I spent around 1 hour making some examples of what scripting rules would look like
for some key interactions in our milestone games, such as moving a rook in chess.

On Monday, March 17, I spent around 1 hour and 50 minutes writing my second version of the ScriptingRule class.

March 19: 57 minutes (3:09 PM to 4:06 PM) were spent doing the start of testing the code I've made so far.
Most of it was spent setting up the testing, not quite doing the testing yet.

March 21: About two hours were spent. Today, I made BGBStructuredClone, made TileType and PieceType actually do things,
added the first four "triggers" for scripts, and tested the scripts and triggers by making the movement rules
for the non-pawn chess pieces (no capturing or collisions yet, just the rules on what directions they're allowed to move).

March 23: Spent around one hour attempting to implement capturing into my testing script
(making progress, but not finished yet)

March 24: Spent around 1 hour and 40 minutes. 35 minutes of this were a group meeting.
The remaining 1 hour and 5 minutes were spent finishing capturing and adding pawns to the chess testing example;
no button support exists yet, so for now promotion is always into a queen.
(this was probably the first item in my timelog that took a lot longer than I expected).

March 25: Spent around 50 minutes wrapping up my chess test example for now, by preventing pieces jumping
and adding the turn structure (only one piece color moves at a time, game ends when a king is captured).

March 26: Group meeting for around 45 minutes, in which we discussed what we've done so far, updated our GANTT chart, and began plans for the UI.

March 27: Group meeting for around 1 hour and 25 minutes, in which we planned who would work on what for the next phase of the project,
creating the UI for game creation. (My main task is the UI for creating scripting rules)

March 28: Spent around 1 hour and 50 minutes making a first draft of how a scripting rule will be displayed for editing
(just display for now, no editing it yet), and starting to add backend support for changing a ScriptingRule that's already made 

March 29: Spent around 2 hours and 10 minutes (of useful time, anyway; plenty of wasted time was mixed in) adding
change-able inputs to the scripting rule visualizer (but not yet changing the types of scripting rules, that's what's next),
during which I added a couple more rule types (Create an Array and two involving global variables).
