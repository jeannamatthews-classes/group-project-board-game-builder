March 11 - I spent about 3 hours working on the design document and the github README.
I completed the entirety of the Technology Stack, Expected Users, Risks & Mitigations, the Wireframe UI for the Creation Screen, the Mockup UI in Canvas, the Sequence Diagram, and the Testing Plan
The design document was very messy, so I organized it with plenty of headers.
I cleaned up the Project Overview and some other text.

March 12 - 1 Hour meeting with the team in which we discussed our plans to potentially meet over spring break. (this did not really come to fruition)

Over Spring Break - Cumulatively, probably an hour or so was spent making the stubs of the HTML pages, including the index page.

March 26 - Hour long meeting with the team where we discussed our plans for the UI involving our plans for and updated the GANTT chart.
March 31 for 1 hour: had a meeting with the whole team.
April  1: currently working on the peice type and tile type editors for the game builder.
April 3 for 1 hour: had a meeting with the team where we dicsussed how we should split up the editing forms in the creation UI phase.
    I ended up taking on the bulk of the main screen forms and agreed to be the one to connect all of them together.

March 28th - I spent a bit over an hour planning and working on how I wanted the board itself to look. (In a separate file)

March 30th - We met on Zoom for about an hour. We talked about what we had gotten done so far in terms of the Scripting Forms, and I inquired as to whether my way of doing the board would be expandable. 
    Decided to continue with what I had.

--This is when more serious work on the code starts to be completed.--

April 3rd - We met during class time for just under 90 minutes.
During this time, I pushed the code I had completed so far. having the main screen and most of the scripting rules done was good progress.

April 5th - I spent 5+ish hours working on the Main Screen UI Code.
- Added Save & Close / Cancel (ends up being removed on April 6th)
    -Save & Close - saves changes made to the tile.
    -Cancel (or clicking x) does not save changes made to the tile. Reverts.

Fixed Tile Edit Window 
    - Edits to the Tile are now properly saved in the internal logic.
    - You can now add multiple pieces, and the UI copies that of adding Types. 
        -Pieces now split into a grid formation when more than 1 piece is placed on the same tile to show all.
    - You can now properly remove Pieces from the board. (becoming inaccessible)
    - Adding Pieces to the Board no longer takes them from the Piece Editor.
    -Implemented Right Click to Remove Piece from Board
Fixed a lot of other Miscellaneous Bugs, both visible and otherwise.


April 6th - I spent most of the day working on the code with scattered focus (probably cumulatively about 5 or so hours)
Added Control Buttons (Preview On/Off, Save Code, Edit)
    First two are currently Dummy functions.

Fixed PiecesEditor.
    Fixed swapping Mechanism to account for edge cases.
    Added Type assignment to Piece Edit Window.
Removed Save/Close and Cancel 
    After a lot of fussing with this mechanic, I decided it caused more trouble than it was worth.
    It would likely not be applied consistently across remaining windows (Types, Globals, etc), 
    so I decided to remove the functionality for now.

Fixed Swapping Mechanism in PieceEditor.
Allow Assignment of Piece Types.
Fixed Types so that the Rows would show up.
